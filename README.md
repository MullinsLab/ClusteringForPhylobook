# ClusteringForPhylobook
This is a repository of R code that clusters sequence data using the GAP procedure and K-mediods clustering.  The input is a folder containing fastA files for all the data within a project.  The output is a collection of files containing the sequence-to-cluster-ID for each clustering run (e.g. the GAP procedure, and various K's in K-mediod clustering).
This R code is designed to run from within R or R studio.  It expects that the working directory will be set to a folder that contains only fasta files.
It will process each fasta file within the directory to generate cluster assignments using the GAP procedure (as publicly available at - https://github.com/vrbiki/GapProcedure) or K-mediods clustering.  The output is a collection of csv files of format "sequence_name, clusterID" - one file for each type of clustering (e.g. GAP procedures and values of K from 2 to KMax).  KMax is adjustable by editing the code as needed.  The purpose of this program is to provide guidance to users of Phylobook during manual selection/editing of lineages.  See - https://github.com/MullinsLab/phylobook for more details.
