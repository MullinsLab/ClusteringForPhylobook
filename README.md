# ClusteringForPhylobook
This is a repository of R code that clusters sequence data using the GAP procedure and K-mediods clustering.  The input is a folder containing fastA files for all the data within a project.  The output is a collection of files containing the sequence-to-cluster-ID for each clustering run (e.g. the GAP procedure, and various K's in K-mediod clustering).
